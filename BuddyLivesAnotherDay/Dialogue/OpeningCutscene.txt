[Buddy sits in a chair in a bare room, a bright light shining on him. Big Star’s silhouette looms over him. Big Dipper (BD) and Lil’ Dipper (LD) stand menacingly behind him.]

BIG STAR: You were supposed to throw the match, Buddy! Do you have any idea how much money you’ve lost me?

BD: A lot. A lot of money.

LD: Yeah! A lot!

BIG STAR: [to BD, LD] Shut up!

BD: Sorry, boss.

LD: Yeah, sorry, boss.

BIG STAR: [To Buddy] Buddy. I taught you everything I know, and this is how you repay me?

[BD and LD start playing guitar and mandolin in a blatant ripoff of The Godfather main theme for Big Star’s soliloquy]

BIG STAR: I picked you up off the street! I was like a father to you! I made you, Buddy! This is how you repay me??

BD: You’re so profound, boss.

LD: Yeah! Profound!

BIG STAR: Well, this is the last straw, Buddy. You’re out! I’ve got a new champion, and she won’t fail me like you did.

[A door opens, with a star-shaped silhouette framed in it. Lil’ Star, the absolutely jacked starfish, stomps in]

BD: But, boss, she’s not even a real Star! She’s just a starfish!

LD: Yeah! A starfish!

LIL STAR: [To BD, LD] A starfish that’s gonna WHUP YOUR ASS!! (Screen shake?) [To Buddy] So, this is the famous Buddy the Wolverine. You don’t look so tough to me.

BIG STAR: You’re done, Buddy. Get out of my sight, and be grateful I’m letting you off this easy.

BD: You tell him, boss.

LD: Yeah! Tell him!

LIL STAR: Come on back to the arena if you ever want a REAL champion to show you how it’s done.
